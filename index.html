        <title>The dangers of hydroxyl acid</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hydroxyl acid is dangerous!</h1>
        <h2>Effects:</h2>
        <p>Hydroxyl acid is an extremely dangerous chemical, present in high quantities in many foods, drinks and household products.</p>
        <p>Hydroxyl acid:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Has been used in extrajudical torture.
                <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterboarding">[1]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li>Is a major component of acid rain.</li>
            <li>Is an extremely potent greenhouse gas (in its gaseous form).
                <sup><a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/greenhouse-gases.php?section=watervapor">[2]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li>Can cause death when inhaled, or consumed in too high a quantity.
                <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning">[3]</a></sup>
                <sup><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/a7452736.html">[4]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li>Acts as a strong solvent.
                <sup><a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/qa-solvent.html">[5]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li>Is a component in many pesticides and industrial chemicals.
                <sup><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/other/industrial/index.html">[6]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li>Has been used as an additive in fast-food</li>
            <li>Is composed of a strong oxidising agent and an extremely flammable gas, making its production extremely dangerous.</li>
            <li>Has been found in engine exhaust gasses.
                <sup><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/z6xbkqt/revision">[7]</a></sup>
            </li>
            <li>Has been responsible for the destruction of towns and villages (costing hundreds of lives) when storage systems have failed.
                <sup><a href="https://www.fema.gov/why-dams-fail">[8]</a></sup>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The effort to ban hydroxyl acid</h2>
        <p>While many experts have warned about the dangerous of hydroxyl acid for years, politicians and lawmakers have been extremely reluctant to control hydroxyl acid.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Citizens have petitioned the UK Goverment on the dangerous of this substance, only to have their petitions closed.</li>
            <li>One survey suggests 86% of Americans would support a ban or controls on hydroxyl acid</li>
            <li>49% of candidates running in the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election are in favour of imposing restrictions on hydroxyl acid.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, to date, very few countries have restrictions on this dangerous, lethal substance. Controls are rarely implemented except in times of shortage, in a concession
            to the chemical and farming industries - while endangering everyone else!</p>
        <h2>The cover-up</h2>
        <p>The dangers of hydroxyl acid have been the subject of many cover-ups. Government officials have refused to comment on its dangers,
            and those that have attempted to introduce legislation against it have been silenced.</p>
        <h2>What can <strong>you</strong> do?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Open a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/">petiton</a>.</li>
            <li>Raise awareness of the issue.</li>
            <li>Join forces with other anti-hydroxyl acid campaigners.</li>
            <li>Research the issue from my favourite, totally accurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_hoax">blog</a>.</li>
