        <p class="intro">Hydroxyl acid is an extremely dangerous chemical, present in high quantities in many foods, drinks and household products.</p>
        <p>This site aims to educate on the dangers of hydroxyl acid.</p>

        <h2 class="toggle">▸The effort to ban hydroxyl acid</h2>
        <div class="togglebox">
            <p>While many experts have warned about the dangerous of hydroxyl acid for years, politicians and lawmakers have been extremely reluctant to control hydroxyl acid.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Citizens have petitioned the UK Goverment on the dangerous of this substance, only to have their petitions closed.</li>
                <li>One survey suggests 86% of Americans would support a ban or controls on hydroxyl acid</li>
                <li>49% of candidates running in the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election are in favour of imposing restrictions on hydroxyl acid.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, to date, very few countries have restrictions on this dangerous, lethal substance. Controls are rarely implemented except in times of shortage, in a concession
                to the chemical and farming industries - while endangering everyone else!</p>

        <h2 class="toggle">▸The cover-up</h2>
        <div class="togglebox">
            <p>The dangers of hydroxyl acid have been the subject of many cover-ups. Government officials have refused to comment on its dangers,
                and those that have attempted to introduce legislation against it have been silenced.</p>
            <p>In the USA, 10 people die each day, on average, as a direct result of hydroxyl acid exposure!
                <sup><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/water-safety/waterinjuries-factsheet.html" class="ref">[9]</a></sup>
                If 10 people were killed by terrorists each day, the Government would declare a national emergency; yet the copious lobbying of industry and Big Farma 
                ensures their precious hydroxyl acid keeps flowing. The mere mention of the dangers of hydroxyl acid in Governments worldwide has ended several 
                politican's careers overnight.</p>
